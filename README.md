## Introduction
The garment industry, driven by tight margins, depends on worker productivity for efficiency and profitability. Variability in performance due to factors like skill levels and conditions disrupts production. Predicting productivity enables managers to optimize processes, address bottlenecks, and meet production targets, ensuring cost management, operational efficiency, and high-quality output.

## Objective
The Garment Worker Productivity Prediction project aims to accurately forecast the productivity of garment factory workers based on various workplace, environmental, and operational factors. This prediction is crucial for optimizing resource allocation, improving workflow efficiency, and maintaining high-quality production standards while reducing operational costs.

## Project Overview
- **Business Understanding**: Exploring the business reasons for our data mining effort and what the company hopes to gain from the project.
- **Data Understanding**: The datasets we utilized comprised of csv files.
- **Data Preparation**: It mainly involved; selecting the data to discover the columns to be used, cleaning the data to correct and remove erroneous values, formatting the data to effectively perform mathematical operations and integrating the datasets to create a merged dataset for effective analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: The goal of this procedure is to summarize the main characteristics of the dataset, which is often done visually.
- **Modelling**: To further support and provide insight we built a hybrid-based system.
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy Score, Mean Absolute Error abd Root Mean Squared Error were used to measure the average of absolute deviance between actual and predicted ratings given by users.
